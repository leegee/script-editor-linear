# ðŸŽ¬ Project Feature List â€” Script Visualizer / Story Matrix

## Core Concepts

### Script Items
- **Single universal entity type** for anything appearing in the script or running order:
  - Dialogue, action, sound cue, lighting change, camera move, etc.
  - Meta items like **Act Marker**, **Scene Marker**, **Beat Marker**
- Script items can occur **sequentially or simultaneously**
- Can have:
  - **Duration** (explicit or computed)
  - **Tags** and **Notes**
  - Links to **Characters**, **Locations**, **Contacts**
- Subtypes and examples:
  - **Marker** â€” Act / Scene / Beat (structural)
  - **Cue** â€” Audio / Lighting / Transition
  - **Dialogue / Action** â€” Character involvement
  - **Other** â€” Anything user-defined
- Each Timeline Item supports **three rendering/edit modes**:
  1. **Simplified View** â€” minimal timeline block
  2. **Medium Detail** â€” inline, summary information
  3. **Full Detail / Editor** â€” complete editable form (with multimedia and links)
- **Edits persist locally** (e.g., IndexedDB tables: `timelineItems`, `characters`, etc.)

---

### Characters
- Represent people or entities with roles in the script
- Have:
  - **Traits / Attributes** (key-value pairs, numeric sliders, categorical flags)
  - **Tags** and **Notes**
  - Optional **photo or avatar**
  - Links to **Timeline Items**, **Locations**, and **Contacts**
- **Full Detail / Editor View:**
  - Character card layout
  - Notes, traits, backstory, appearance
  - Optional visual media and reference links

---

### Locations
- Represent physical or conceptual places
- Have:
  - **Tags** and **Notes**
  - Links to **Timeline Items**, **Characters**, and **Contacts**
- **Full Detail / Editor View:**
  - Map editor or layout view
  - Linked contacts (e.g., liaison, owner)
  - Optional media (photos, documents, blueprints)
  - Scene/sequence references

---

### Tags
- **Universal linking system** for all entities
- Any entity (Timeline Item, Character, Location, Note) can have **multiple tags**
- Tags can represent:
  - **Themes** (e.g., *Hope*, *Isolation*, *Redemption*)
  - **Story Arcs**
  - **Character Arcs**
  - Or any conceptual grouping (*Mood*, *Motif*, *Symbolism*)
- **Default tag categories:**
  - `THEME`
  - `STORY ARC`
  - `CHARACTER ARC`
- Tags can:
  - Have **color codes**
  - Contain **Notes** and **Traits**
  - Be **nested** or **linked** (hierarchical or associative)
- **Themes and arcs are tag types, not entities**

---

### Notes
- **Attachable to anything** (Timeline Item, Character, Location, Tag)
- Can themselves be **tagged**
- Support:
  - **Rich text (Markdown or WYSIWYG)**
  - **Optional media links** (images, audio, video, documents)
  - **Nested or threaded** discussions
- Notes can appear as annotations in timelines or overlays

---

## UI Features

### Timeline / 3D Perspective View
- WebGL-based **skewed perspective timeline**
  - Shows chronological sequence stretching into distance
  - Smooth transitions between flat and 3D views
- Items appear as panels or nodes in perspective
- Can filter or dim by:
  - **Tag**
  - **Character**
  - **Location**
- Items with durations appear stretched; instantaneous items appear as points
- Supports **zoom / pan / rotate**
- Animation-ready CSS transforms for transitions

---

### Column / Matrix View
- Displays chronological **columns** of entities (timeline items, characters, etc.)
- Filters by **tag**, **character**, or **location**
- **Zoom / Focus Mode:**
  - Zoom enlarges selected column
  - Others shrink and dim
  - Further zoom blurs and darkens surrounding area (focus)
  - Controlled via:
    - Buttons
    - Mouse wheel + modifier key
    - Pinch gesture
- Columns color-coded by tag or arc
- Optional overlays for **story arc visualization**

---

## Data Model
- Every entity:
  - Has a **UUID**
  - Has timestamps / duration
  - Has **tags** and **notes**
  - Has **cross-links** (references to other entities)
- Entities are stored locally (IndexedDB or LocalStorage)
  - Example: `indexeddb.timelineItems`, `indexeddb.characters`, etc.
- Relationships are **bidirectional** for fast lookup
- Multiple simultaneous timelines supported (parallel actions)

---

## Future / Planned Features
- **Audio/video synchronization** for media-based timeline items
- **Timeline playback** (real-time simulation)
- **Collaboration** (multi-user, shared state)
- **Version history** and change diffing
- **Import/export** (Fountain, Final Draft, etc.)
- **AI-assisted tagging / trait inference**
- **Plugin system** for visualizations or integrations

---

## Technical Goals
- SolidJS + TypeScript reactive architecture
- IndexedDB-backed local persistence
- Modular data schemas (JSON-based storage)
- WebGL/Canvas hybrid renderer for perspective and timeline modes
- Accessibility and keyboard shortcuts
- Multi-touch and gesture support

## Summary

- **TimelineItem** is the universal timeline entity  
- **Character** and **Location** extend via references  
- **Tag** and **Note** are shared, universal linkable layers  
- **Storage** is local-first (IndexedDB), ready for sync extension  
- **UI** and **Renderer** operate reactively from the same data graph

## Timeline Schema (Chronological + Simultaneous TimelineItems)

```mermaid
gantt
    dateFormat  mm:ss
    axisFormat  %M:%S
    title Example Timeline Structure â€” Overlapping TimelineItems

    section Structural Markers
    Act 1 Marker           :milestone, 00:00, 0s
    Scene 1 Marker         :milestone, 00:00, 0s
    Beat 1 Marker          :milestone, 00:10, 0s

    section Script Items
    Dialogue: Character A   :active, 00:10, 10s
    Dialogue: Character B   :active, 00:12, 8s
    Sound Cue (Door Slam)   :done,   00:13, 2s
    Lighting Change         :crit,   00:15, 4s
    Camera Move (Pan Left)  :active, 00:17, 5s

    section Simultaneous Actions
    Background Music Start  :active, 00:10, 30s
    Crowd Ambience          :active, 00:10, 20s

    section Meta / Transition
    Scene 2 Marker          :milestone, 00:40, 0s
    Transition: Fade Out    :done, 00:45, 5s
```

---

## Interpretation

- **Markers** (Act, Scene, Beat) are `TimelineItem` subtypes with **zero duration**
- **Dialogue**, **Action**, **Cue**, **Transition** are standard `TimelineItems` with duration
- **Simultaneous actions** (e.g., sound, music) run **in parallel** with others  
- **Timeline** supports:
  - Explicit durations (`start + length`)
  - Implicit durations (computed or assigned)
  - Overlaps (multiple active items in same time range)

---

## Rendering Rules (planned)

| Type | Visual Representation | Editable Fields | Notes |
|------|------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Marker | Line or flag | Label, type | Anchors sections of timeline |
| Dialogue / Action | Block or card | Character, duration, text | May overlap other dialogue |
| Cue (sound/light/camera) | Thin bar or icon | Type, timing | Layered under main track |
| Transition | Fade band | Type, duration | May bridge between scenes |
| Meta (e.g., Theme Tag) | Overlay band or icon | Tag reference | Filters across multiple scenes |

---

## Next Steps (Visual Layer)

- Implement timeline rendering using **WebGL / CSS transforms**  
- Animate zoom, skew, and focus transitions between:
  - Flat script list view
  - 3D perspective view  
- Allow **filtering by tag, character, or location**
- Enable **drag-to-adjust duration** and **simultaneous event alignment**
